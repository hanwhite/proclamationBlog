                    Motherhood is continuously degraded and undervalued
                    by the world. This degrading is the work of the adversary.
                    Many involved in the feminist movement believe that
                    motherhood makes women vulnerable and should be avoided,
                    because it means women are dependent on a man for financial
                    reasons. However, is that not the point of marriage? Are the
                    men not dependent on the women to care for their children with
                    every ounce of love and selflessness that they have, teaching
                    them to be good people and nurturing them with all of their
                    heart? Despite the determination the adversary has to degrade
                    motherhood as much as possible, motherhood will never be less
                    than the most important, significant, and divine role a woman
                    can ever have.

                    The responsibilities mothers have are central in preserving the
                    lives of their children and fostering their children’s growth and
                    development, mentally and physically. Effective mothers are sensitive
                    to their child’s needs, and are responsive to them. Mothers have a
                    profound amount of influence on the children they raise. A secure
                    attachment between mother and child results in a child that feels that
                    they deserve to be loved, and they have an easier time learning to
                    understand and empathize with others. Individual adaptation is required
                    for unique situations, and it is important to remember the words of
                    Sheri Dew, who said, “Every one of us can show by word and by deed
                    that the work of women in the Lord’s kingdom is magnificent and holy.
                    I repeat: We are all mothers in Israel, and our calling is to love
                    and help lead the rising generation through the dangerous streets of
                    mortality.”

                    It is just as essential for mothers to care for themselves as it is
                    for them to care for their children. Elder M. Russell Ballard explains,
                    “Find some times for yourself to cultivate your gifts and interests.
                    Pick one or two things that you would like to learn or do that will
                    enrich you life, and make time for them. Water cannot be drawn from
                    an empty well, and if you are not setting aside a little time for
                    what replenishes you, you will have less and less to give to others,
                    even to your children.” Motherhood is a demanding calling that is not
                    always filled with perfect, joyful moments. By making time for themselves,
                    mothers give themselves the ability to fill their “well”, so they may
                    continue to give to others.
