                <div class="paragraphLong">Fatherhood, like motherhood, is the most imdiv class="paragraphLong"ortant and divine responsibility a man can have. The active presence of fathers as leaders in a family unit are fundamental to a healthy family life. The principles of fathering are outlined as the ability to preside, partner, be present, provide, and protect. </div>
                <br>
                <div class="paragraphLong">To preside means to be a spiritual leader and guide his family in “love and righteousness” (D&C 121:41-42). Presiding requires that fathers teach and love their children, leading them down a righteous path and setting foundations for them to be spiritually in tune for the rest of their lives. Fathers, according to Abraham Heschel, are responsible to be teachers and “holy figures” for their families. Fathers have a great influence on how their children grow spiritually. To preside also means to be involved in his children’s lives. Children with positively involved fathers statistically show greater self-control, perform better academically, and have more empathy towards others. </div>
                <br>
                <div class="paragraphLong">To partner means to work in the partnership that is parenting. This means the child’s mother, but also the extended family that is involved in the child’s life, and the community the child is being raised in. By partnering with others in order to raise his children, the father commits to help and support them. Whether married or not, maintaining a positive relationship with the child’s mother will produce the best outcomes for the child. This principle also requires that the father partner with his child. It is essential that fathers work on and continually be involved in their relationship with their children. From birth on, fathers have a significant influence on their children’s lives. </div>
                <br>
                <div class="paragraphLong">To be a present father means just that - to be there for his children. In order to meet children’s emotional needs and create a strong bond with his children, a father must be present in their lives. This requires both quantity and quality time. Children require the presence of caring, loving parents from the time they are born. They will learn to rely on them and to trust them. </div>
                <br>
                <div class="paragraphLong">It is outlined in The Family: A Proclamation to the World that one of the important roles a father has is to provide for the family. Raising a family comes with material demands and requirement of resources. By providing those resources and needs for the family, a father gives his children opportunity to grow into healthy adults. </div>
                <br>
                <div class="paragraphLong">There are many ways fathers protect their children. The preparation for them to enter the world as adults is one of them. It is important for children to learn skills and knowledge about how to be independent and deal with the trials that come with life. Fathers can also protect their families spiritually by being powerful spiritual influences in their families. Fathers are accountable unto God for their efforts in following these principles to be leaders and rocks in their families. They have great ability to influence and teach their children for good.</div>
