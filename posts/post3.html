                            Sex and intimacy between husband and wife represent the 
                            physical and spiritual oneness between them. Sex within 
                            the bonds of marriage should be treated as a sacred, intimate 
                            connection authorized by God to fulfill His commandments and 
                            progress together as husband and wife. In Successful Marriages 
                            and Families: Proclamation Principles and Research Perspectives, 
                            sex within the bonds of marriage is described as serving “several 
                            purposes for both husband and wife as individuals as well as for 
                            the couple relationship. These purposes include becoming one, 
                            connecting with God, strengthening the emotional and spiritual 
                            bonds in marriage, avoiding temptation, and continuing the 
                            generational chain by bringing children into a family.”

                            On the subject of becoming one with your spouse, David A. 
                            Bednar said, “The natures of male and female spirits complete 
                            and perfect each other, and therefore men and women are intended 
                            to progress together toward exaltation.” Intimacy is an essential 
                            part of this progression. It is worth noting that Elder Bednar 
                            specifies “male and female spirits”. Our gender is not only 
                            determined by our biological, physical bodies, but by our spirits 
                            as well. Male and female spirits are meant to complete and connect 
                            with each other, spiritually as well as physically. As the adversary 
                            continually attempts to make sex more casual in the world, it is 
                            imperative that we continue to teach about and treat it with 
                            sacredness and reverence. The purpose of connecting with God 
                            through martial sex and intimacy is described by Elder Jeffery 
                            R. Holland, who stated, “Sexual intimacy is … symbolic of a union 
                            between mortals and deity, between otherwise ordinary and fallible 
                            humans uniting for a rare and special moment with God Himself and 
                            all the powers by which He gives life in this wide universe of ours.”

                            One purpose of sex that is agreed upon by most of the world is that 
                            it is used to strengthen and express connection and love for one’s 
                            spouse. It is important to understand that the act of sex is not in 
                            and of itself a sin, but it can be used in a sinful way. Sex is more 
                            than a way to find individual physical pleasure. Sexual intimacy 
                            should only be used between husband and wife as a way to respectfully, 
                            lovingly, and intimately connect with each other and God.

                    <div class="paragraphLong">
                            One of God’s first commandments was to multiply and replenish the 
                            Earth (Genesis 1:28). There are many ways to achieve and follow this 
                            commandment. The first is sexual intimacy in a marriage to bring life 
                            into the world with biological children. However, there are many 
                            situations involving infertility that can prevent a couple from 
                            bringing children into their family this way. This can impact the 
                            number of children they desire to have and the timing involved. 
                            Temple sealings allow married couples to fulfill this commandment 
                            in other ways by bringing children into their family through adoption. 
                            In Successful Marriages and Families: Proclamation Principles and Research 
                            Perspectives, it also explains that those who are physically unable to have 
                            children are still entitled to blessings through adoption, and “the Abrahamic 
                            blessing of eternal increase is a promise that extends beyond the boundaries 
                            of the earth life.” (Harper and Feinaur, Chapter 5). The decision of when and 
                            how to have children is a sacred decision that is made between a husband, 
                            wife, and God only. Outside opinions do not apply to a couple’s decision on 
                            when and how they want to have children. Every situation, and every couple, 
                            are unique. Elder Dallin H. Oaks stated, “How many children should a couple 
                            have? All they can care for! Of course, to care for children means more than 
                            simply giving them life. Children must be loved, nurtured, taught, fed, clothed, 
                            housed, and well started in their capacities to be good parents themselves.” 
                            It is also important to consider the physical and mental health of both the husband 
                            and the wife when deciding the timing and amount of children they can have. 
                            There are no black-and-white guidelines to follow when it comes to this decision. 
                            It is a situation to use agency, prayer, and thoughtful discussions with one’s spouse 
                            in order to come to a conclusion based on a couple’s circumstances.

                            With the establishment that sexual intercourse in a marriage is extremely important 
                            and necessary comes the question of how often a husband and wife should perform this 
                            sacred act. According to David Schnarch, a licensed clinical psychologist Board 
                            Certified in Couple and Family Psychology, “there is always a low desire partner, 
                            just as there is always a high desire partner - and there is one of each in every 
                            relationship.” He states that though husband and wife may want the same thing, one 
                            will want it more often than the other. The difference in the level of desire may 
                            vary from couple to couple, and some may not recognize it as a pertinent issue. 
                            However for those that do, it can become a stressful and anxious  topic, resulting 
                            in those feelings being tied to intimacy. This is where the “good enough sex” approach 
                            can be introduced. “Good enough sex” is a term coined by McCarthy and Metz, who teach 
                            that martial sexuality should be flexible and pressure associated with sexual intercourse 
                            should be taken away from it. This approach teaches that the expectation that sexual 
                            interaction should always end in “100 percent satisfactory results” (Harper and Feinaur, 
                            Chapter 5) is unrealistic and can feel demanding for one or both spouses. Once spouses 
                            can work on “abandoning a goal of ‘perfect performance’” (Harper and Feinaur, Chapter 5) 
                            they are able to work on getting over the fears, stress, and pressures that can be 
                            associated with intercourse, performances, and actions by feeling relaxed about the 
                            subject. Marital sexuality requires that spouses learn to be open and honest with each 
                            other about their feelings and experiences, and with that comes trust within the couple.
