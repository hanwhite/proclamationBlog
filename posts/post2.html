                        Equality between genders is often mistaken to mean that they are identical. 
                        The roles and responsibilities outlined in The Family: A Proclamation to the 
                        World are different for men and women. Before outlining those responsibilities, 
                        it is essential to understand that men and women were created differently by 
                        Heavenly Father. The Proclamation states, “Gender is an essential characteristic 
                        of individual premarital, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose.” There are 
                        some responsibilities that are set upon both husband and wife, such as rearing 
                        their children in “love and righteousness”, providing for their needs physically 
                        and spiritually, teaching them, being law-abiding citizens, following the commandments, 
                        and honoring their marriage with “complete fidelity”. 
                        The Proclamation outlines the specific, divine roles of mothers and fathers. It states, 
                        “By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness 
                        and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families. 
                        Mothers and primarily responsible for the nurture of their children.” Neither the husband 
                        nor the wife has a more essential job than the other. Equal partnership in a marriage does 
                        not mean identical roles, it means their roles are of equal importance. Elder Earl C. Tingey 
                        stated, “You must not misunderstand what the Lord meant when Adam was told he was to have a 
                        helpmeet. A helpmeet is a companion suited to or equal to [the other]. [They] walk side 
                        by side … not one before or behind the other. A helpmeet results in an absolute equal 
                        partnership between a husband and a wife. Eve was to be equal to Adam as a husband and 
                        wife are to be equal to each other.”
