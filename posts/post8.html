                    The ideas created by the adversary have moved further and further away from the principles outlined in The Family: A Proclamation to the World. Those who believe these principles are true have consistently been attacked for those beliefs, being called “bigoted” or “unaccepting” of those who do not follow the principles in the Proclamation. Latter-day Saints are the messengers who spread Christ’s gospel around the world. With that responsibility comes the responsibility to defend The Proclamation and our beliefs when it is necessary. A tip given in Successful Marriages and Families, Chapter 34, is to memorize The Proclamation so we are able to give specific excerpts from it when a conversation goes in that direction. One person gave out The Proclamation as a gift to work associates. The little things we do throughout our lives can have big impacts on people. With the presence of social media, we each have an almost unlimited outreach to those around the world where we can spread the gospel.
