                        First, it is essential to understand that we all came to 
                            this Earth with preexisting personality traits and spiritual 
                            gifts. These traits and gifts are impacted heavily by the 
                            environments in which we are born in to and the biological 
                            characteristics that come with our individual bodies. Because 
                            of the vast uniqueness of each individual on this Earth, it is 
                            important for parents to recognize that they may need to adjust 
                            their parenting style with each of their children. All children 
                            have their own combinations of strengths and weaknesses, and parents 
                            are responsible for helping them overcome their weaknesses and 
                            build upon their strengths (Successful Marriages and Families, 
                            Chapter 10).
                        <br><br>
                        According to the book, Successful Marriages and Families, the 
                        most important elements that need to be present in children’s 
                        lives are:
                        <br>
                        - Love, support, and warmth<br>
                        - Learn, reasonable expectations<br>
                        - Limits and boundaries with some room for compromise and negotiation<br>
                        - Reasoning and consequences that are developmentally appropriate for breaking pre-established limits<br>
                        - Opportunities to make their own choices<br>
                        - No hostile forms of discipline, which includes harsh physical punishment, the withdrawal of love, shaming, and inflicting guilt onto a child<br>
                        - Models of good behavior, self-control, and positive values and attitudes<br>
                        <br>
                        There are several different style of parenting, and of them all, 
                        the authoritative style of parenting is one that meets all of the 
                        requirements above and is closest to what is outlined in The Family: 
                        A Proclamation to the World. The styles of parenting include coercive 
                        parenting, permissive parenting, authoritarian parenting, and authoritative 
                        parenting. 
                        <br><br>
                        Coercive parenting and authoritarian (not to be confused with authoritative) 
                        parenting is hostile, demeaning, and psychologically controlling. Parents 
                        who use this style of parenting frequently punish their children physically 
                        by spanking, and they yell, criticize, and force their children. They 
                        communicate disinterest in their children’s lives, invalidate their feelings, 
                        condescend and patronize their children, and withdraw love as a punishment. 
                        This style of parenting can have extremely negative effects on children by 
                        making them withdraw from other, act out, and follow their parents example in 
                        forcing other to do things. The psychological control these children experience 
                        in childhood can lead to them acting aggressively towards others. D&C 121 describes 
                        why this type of parenting is wrong, it is controlling, dominating, and destructive 
                        of children’s right to practice free agency. Coercive parenting is demeaning to the 
                        unique developing personality and individualism of the children involved. Gordon B. 
                        Hinckley said, “Children don’t need beating. They need love and encouragement.” 
                        <br><br>
                        Permissive parenting is almost opposite of coercive - there is almost 
                        no control over the children. Permissive parents do not use the divine authority 
                        over their children and do not give them stable boundaries for them to stay in. 
                        Consequences restrictions, and expectations for children to behave are rare. These 
                        children grow to have a problem respecting others and are defiant of authority. This 
                        type of parenting also includes overindulgence of the children, or “spoiling” them. 
                        <br><br>
                        Authoritative parenting is scientifically the best and most optimal way to raise children. 
                        It involves putting developmentally appropriate and consistent boundaries on behavior 
                        and expectations, and allows room for children to make their own decisions and practice 
                        their right to free agency. Likewise, Heavenly Father gave us commandments and limits, 
                        yet there are expectations and natural consequences to our actions. This style of parenting 
                        also allows parents to work on their children individually based on their unique needs that 
                        come with their personality. Although children can be raised in the exact same environment, 
                        each of them will be vastly different and experience vastly different trials and struggles. 
                        This requires parents to set more or less limits on each child based on their individual needs. 
                        Children raised by this parenting style are less likely to be aggressive or defiant. They are 
                        better communicators, self-motivated, and do better academically. Studies show they also present 
                        more self-control and are better at moral reasoning. This parenting style works best when parents 
                        agree and unify in their methods. The three main characteristics of this style are connection, 
                        regulation, and autonomy; or love, limits, and latitude.

                        It is essential that parents make a conscious effort to love and connect with their children. 
                        President Gordon B. Hinckley said, “Every child is entitled to grow up in a home where there is 
                        warm and secure companionship, where there is love in the family relationship, where appreciation 
                        one for another is taught and exemplified, and where God is acknowledged…” By showing love to our 
                        children, we teach them how to love themselves. Children raised in a loving, responsive environment 
                        are less likely to be hostile, resentful, and angry. It is imperative to make children a priority 
                        in parent’s lives. M. Russell Ballard stated, “Mothers must not fall into the trap of believing that 
                        ‘quality’ time can replace ‘quantity’ time. Quality is a direct function of quantity - and mothers, 
                        to nurture their children properly, must provide both. To do so requires constant vigilance and a 
                        constant juggling of competing demands. It is hard work, no doubt about it.”
                        <br><br>
                        All boundaries, limits, discipline and correction in a child’s life should be based on a genuine 
                        interest to lovingly teach and motivate them to correct behavior and principles. Parents should be 
                        firm and clear about expectations and rules in their home, and provide reasoning for them to the children. 
                        Discipline and consequences should be consistent. Parents can create a sense of security for their 
                        children by setting appropriate limits for them. Positive reinforcement will help children understand 
                        when they are within the limits and promote good behavior. When this type of parenting is done correctly, 
                        limits can be loosened as children grow older and take on more responsibilities in their lives. According 
                        to Successful Marriages and Families, Chapter 10, ”Authoritative strategies might include reproving, 
                        withdrawing privileges, setting up opportunities to make restitution, or following through on predetermined 
                        consequences for breaking rules.” Although, there may be situations where misbehavior is best ignored, and 
                        that is when the misbehavior is a result of an underlying problem, such as teething, not enough sleep, 
                        friends being mean, etc. If the misbehavior does not directly harm anyone, it might be best to leave it 
                        be and connect with the child to solve the underlying problem. It is also important to teach children about 
                        natural consequences to their actions. For example, other children most likely do not want to play with 
                        someone who is bossy or does not share. Explaining natural consequences to children can help them understand 
                        on a deeper level not only what they should be doing, but why they should be doing it. Parents should be 
                        lovingly guiding their children in the right direction until they can make good decisions on their own.

                    <div class="paragraphLong">
                            The third characteristic in authoritative parenting is latitude. Children can learn a great deal from 
                            opportunities where they can make their own decisions. It is the parents responsibility to decide which 
                            choices are given to the children, and to make them age appropriate. For example, asking a toddler what 
                            color shirt he would like to wear that day, and give him two options. Or asking a 4 year old what cereal 
                            he would like to eat out of the presented choices. An essential part of authoritative parenting is to 
                            respect the differences that come up between parents and children. Parents should know that children have 
                            individual, independent feelings and thoughts. Showing this respect to children will result in children 
                            learning to show similar respect to their parents and to others. Trust in a parent-child relationship is 
                            expected to go both ways. Children, especially as they enter their teen years, should be given opportunities 
                            to negotiate rules they feel are unfair or should be changed based on their age or maturity. These conversations 
                            should end with both parents and child coming to a conclusion that they can both be happy with. By following 
                            these practices in allowing children to make their own decisions and giving opportunities to do so, children 
                            will be more prepared for real-life decision making. In conclusion, authoritative parenting requires flexibility. 
                            It is essential that parents act as examples towards children and live by the three main characteristics of 
                            good parenting, love, limits, and latitude.
