                <div class="paragraphLong">Repentance and forgiveness is an interactive process in family life. When one repents, the other must know how to forgive. There are three factors that influence a person’s decision to forgive another, that are situational factors, relational factors, and personality factors. Each situation that requires forgiveness is unique, and some are much more difficult than others. Elder Dallin H. Oaks said, “The gospel of Jesus Christ challenges us to change. . . . Repenting means giving up all of our practices—personal, family, ethnic, and national—that are contrary to the commandments of God. The purpose of the gospel is to transform common creatures into celestial citizens, and that requires change.” Christ taught, “And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses,” (Mark 11:25–26). When we repent, we hope and expect forgiveness from Heavenly Father. How can we have that hope if we are unwilling to forgive others? Reconciliation with others usually requires apologies. However, what happens when there is no apology? When the other person does not believe they did wrong, or hurt you, or they just don’t care? Holding onto that anger and holding a grudge is detrimental to our wellbeing. It is essential we learn how to forgive, so we can do it in the more difficult situations. The steps to one-way forgiveness are outlined as: recognize the offense, sorrow for the offense, disclose, avoid the offending behavior, and make restitution. When genuine forgiveness is achieved, our well-being improves. Repentance does not require reconciliation. Sometimes it is not possible because of situational circumstances. In order for true reconciliation to happen, both parties must be willing to humble themselves, repent, and forgive. It is a two-way effort, and will not work if only one person is working on it. Repentance and forgiveness are expectations from God that we should all apply to our lives. </div>
